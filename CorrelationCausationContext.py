'Your colleague is looking to measure productivity throughout the Firm. After doing some research, they note that the number of cats adopted by employees has increased as number of hours logged at the computer has increased. '
'‚ÄúNaturally,‚Äù your colleague concludes, ‚Äúhaving cats causes employees to spend more time at their computer. If we want to increase productivity, we should encourage employees to adopt more cats.‚Äù '
'Let‚Äôs explore this claim. We‚Äôll start with the first piece: the relationship between number of cats and number of hours logged. The relationship your colleague has noted is a :red[__correlation__]. '
'What is correlation? Correlation describes the __linear relationship__ between two variables. This relationship is described by __strength and direction__ (positive or negative). '

'A __positive relationship__ between two variables means that as __one increases, the other increases__. For example, the number of cats I have and the amount of cat food I purchase. Conversely, a __negative relationship__ means that as __one variable increases, the other decreases__. For example, the number of cats in my household, and the number of fragile items I leave on my counters.  '
